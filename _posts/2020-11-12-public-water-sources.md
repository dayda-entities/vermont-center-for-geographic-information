This GIS layer consists of the geographic location of active and inactive public (Community, non-transient non-community and transient non-community) water sources labeled by the Water System Identification Number (WSID) and source number (i.e. WL001 or IN002).  The water source data and locations are drawn from the State Drinking Water database (SDWIS).  The water sources are wells, springs and surface water intakes that predate regulations developed in the 1970s to the present.  
SDWIS is the repository for state and federal information collected from and about each public water system in Vermont, including bulk and bottled water facilities along with water production and water quality data.  &quot;<div><br /><div>For information regarding attributes of Public Water Source feature layers, please download the:<br /><a href='http://anrmaps.vermont.gov/websites/OpenData/DataDictionaries/PublicWaterSourcesDataDictionary.xlsx' target='_blank'>Public Water Sources Data Dictionary</a><br /></div></div>
