(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/WaterHydro_DLGSW.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The WaterHydro_DLGSW layer represents surface waters (hydrography) at a scale of RF 100000. WaterHydro_DLGSW was derived from RF100000 USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG). DLG's of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources. Refer to the USGS web site from more information on DLGs (http://www.usgs.gov)
