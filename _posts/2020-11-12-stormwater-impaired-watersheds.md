<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Stormwater impaired watersheds occuring on both the Priority Waters (Part D - Completed TMDL) and 303(d) list of waters (Part A - need TMDL) The Vermont State Legislature has required the Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) to develop water quality remediation plans for each of the stormwater impaired waters listed on the year 2004 303(d) list of impaired waters. This effort, the Vermont Stormwater Project, is being executed by the Stormwater Management Section (SMS) of the Water Quality Division (WQD) using the "Stormwater Cleanup Plan Framework" publication as guidance in developing these remediation plans. The term "303(d)" refers to a section of the Federal Clean Water Act that requires all states to develop lists of impaired waters not meeting Water Quality Standards. The Federal Clean Water Act requires "Total Maximum Daily Loads" (TMDLs) to be developed for waters on the list along with a schedule for implementation. "A TMDL is the calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet Vermont Water Quality Standards. In a broader sense, a TMDL is a plan that identifies the pollutant reductions a water body needs to meet Vermont's Water Quality Standards and develops a means to implement those reductions."</span></p></div></div></div>
