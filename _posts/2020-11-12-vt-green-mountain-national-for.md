(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/TourismTrails_GMNFTRAILS.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) GMNFTRAILS contains minor Forest Service roads and all trails within the proclamation boundary of the Green Mountain National Forest and many of the public roads and trails from Addison, Bennington, Rutland, Washington, Windham, and Windsor Counties, Vermont. A road is a motor vehicle travel way over 50 inches wide, unless classified and managed as a trail. A road may be classified or unclassified. Classified roads are roads within National Forest System lands planned and managed for motor vehicle access including State roads, county roads, private roads, permitted roads, and Forest Service roads. Unclassified roads are roads not intended to be a part of nor managed as a part of the forest transportation system, such as temporary roads, and unplanned, unengineered, unauthorized off-road vehicle tracks and abandoned travel ways. A trail is a linear feature constructed for the purpose of allowing the free movement of people or stock. Original linework was derived from Forest Service Cartographic Feature Files and supplemented with state-wide data from the Vermont Agency of Transportation. However, these original sources have been highly refined and edited. See the Data Quality section for more details. GMNFTRAILS dataset contains three main feature classes 1) route_ltat = Long Trail (LT) and Appalachian Trail (AT) within the GMNF 2) route_trail = All trails within the GMNF 3) route_road = All roads (excluding highways) within the GMNF GMNFTRAILS exludes the route_highway and "arc" features from the original TRAVEL_ROUTE coverage.
