(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/UtilityTelecom_TELEFAC.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The UtilityTelecom_TELEFAC data layer contains points which are intended to represent the location of telecommunications facilities (towers and/or antennas) in Vermont. 1900 points were derived the FCC Antenna Structure Database (LOCMETH = 1). The remainder of the points were added since 2000 by the Natural Resources Board based on Act 250 permit information. Any many cases the spatial accuracy of the data is questionable, and many of the attributes have null values. Contact Lou Borie for the latest data. Refer to Point_of_Contact below.
