<div style='text-align:Left;'><p><span><span>The stream geomorphic assessment (SGA) is a physical assessment competed by geomorphologists to determine the condition and sensitivity of a stream.   The SGA Reach Breaks are points that indicate where the Phase 1 SGA reach breaks are.  They are based on changes in topography, slope and valley setting.  Where there is a significant change in any of the above there is a reach break created.  </span></span></p></div>
