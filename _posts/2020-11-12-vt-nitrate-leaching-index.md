(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/GeologicSoils_NITRATELI.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) Nitrate Leaching Index data for the state of Vermont. This is a derivative product based on the SSURGO soils data for all counties except Essex Co., which does not yet have SSURGO soils data. Precipitation data from PRISM averaged over the 1971-2000 30-year span was used in the Leaching Index formulae. Layer was dissolved so that soil polygons with the same leaching index category were merged. 68 polygons in this layer.
