(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/BoundaryOther_HOUS2002.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The House district lines for this layer were determined from maps posted on the Vermont Legislature website (http://www.leg.state.vt.us/reports/02redistricting/), whilst the geospatial lines were selected from the datalayers - BoundaryTown_TBHASH (replaced by BNDHASH 6/2003), WaterHydro_VHD, TransRoad_RDS, Water Hydro_LKCH100, and TransRail_RR. Each House district is comprised of existing Vermont town boundaries, roads, railroads, rivers or streams, lake boundaries, or Block boundaries from DemoCensus_TIGER 2000 data (obtained from the 'Geography Network' - http://www.geographynetwork.com/) The redistricting process of the Vermont State House and Senate is regulated by Act 151., which is an act relating to professional regulation and redistricting the Senate and the House of Representatives. During conference negotiations between the House and Senate, it became necessary (for technical reasons) to append ALL of S.300, including both House and Senate reapportionment plans, to House Bill H.761, the Professional Regulation bill, which was passed as Act 151, An Act Relating to Professional Regulation and Redistricting the House and Senate, completing the 2002 legislative reapportionment.
