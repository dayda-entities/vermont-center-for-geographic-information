<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span>This dataset is a statewide polygon coverage of sand, gravel, and stone resources. This database includes the best data available from the VT Agency of Natural Resources and VTrans quadrangle maps where sand and gravel locations are noted. Sources are maps from "Geology for Environmental Planning" booklets prepared by Charles G. Doll in the 1970's, the data were derived from USGS sources. VCGI expects that this data will be updated and added to by other sources, but it is the most complete/accurate data available to us at this time.</span></p></div></div>
