The Neighborhood Development Area designation encourages municipalities and/or developers to plan for new and infill housing in the area within walking distance of its designated downtown, village center, new town center, or within its designated growth center and incentivizes needed housing, further supporting the commercial establishments in the designated centers. If available, the data is submitted by the Regional Planning Commissions as Shapefiles otherwise the approved map is scanned and digitized or parcel boundaries are used to build the boundary.  <a href='http://accd.vermont.gov/community-development/designation-programs' target='_blank'>Learn more about the Vermont Designation Programs.</a>
