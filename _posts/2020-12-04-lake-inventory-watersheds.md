The VT DEC (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation) manages an inventory of lake and pond information. The &quot;Lakes and Ponds Inventory&quot; stores the Watershed Management Division's survey and monitoring information used to determines water quality problems and ways to solve them. A project completed by ADS-ANR GIS staff delineated the watersheds and created a web mapping application that allows Lakes Program staff to review, edit, and upload new watershed boundaries for the 800+ lakes in the Lakes Inventory. The layer has editor tracking enabled and filters on “accepted” watersheds.
