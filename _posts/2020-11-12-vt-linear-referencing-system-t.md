LRS2018 is a Linear Referencing System layer that includes Interstate, U.S., State (VT), and other transportation routes logged by the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The routes in this layer represent the town-based (TWN) route system, meaning that routes increment from start to finish within each town, resetting to zero at the town boundaries.<div>Stewards: Information Technology, Data Owner: Mapping Unit</div>
