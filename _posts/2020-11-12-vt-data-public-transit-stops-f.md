(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/TransOther_PUBLICTRANS.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) REFRESHED WEEKLY. Public-transportation route and stop layers derived from GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) feeds. Includes data from multiple Vermont GTFS-feeds with the intention of providing statewide layers (covering the state where GTFS feeds are known and available). THIS DATASET IS A DERIVATIVE, NOT ORIGINAL/MASTER/OFFICIAL DATA. ITS ACCURACY ISN'T GUARANTEED. DISCREPANCIES CAN BE REPORTED TO CORRESPONDING TRANSIT AGENCIES.
