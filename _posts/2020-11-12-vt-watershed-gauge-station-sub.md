(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/WaterOther_WATGAGE.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The project was designed to delineate and digitize major watershed boundaries within Vermont based on the U.S. Hydrologic Unit Code System. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) contracted with the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Lab (UVM) to delineate and digitize watershed boundaries based on RF 24000 topographic quadrangles covering all of Vermont. This coverage was developed along with the WaterHydro_WATSHED coverage.
