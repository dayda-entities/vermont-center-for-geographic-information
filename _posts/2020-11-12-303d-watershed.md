<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act requires Vermont, every two years, to prepare a list of all surface waters in the state for which beneficial uses - such as for drinking, recreation, aquatic habitat, and industrial use - are impaired by pollutants. These are surface waters not expected to meet Vermont Water Quality Standards within a reasonable time even after best management practices are applied. All impaired surface waters listed require the development and implementation of a pollutant loading and reduction plan, or TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load). The 2010 Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list, Vermont 303(d) List of Waters, has been prepared in accordance with the Vermont Surface Water Assessment and Listing Methodology, current EPA Guidance, and the Environmental Protection Regulations 40 CFR 130.7. </span></p></div></div></div>
