(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/LandLandcov_Buildings2016.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) Building polygons derived from circa 2016 high-resolution remotely sensed data. Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to automatically extract building polygons from a combination of 2016 LiDAR and 2016 Orthoimagery. The resultant building polygons were then subjected to a manual review at a scale of 1:3000. This dataset contains footprints for buildings and some large out buildings. Many garages and sheds are not included in this dataset.
