(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EconStats_LMAS2015.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) Model of Vermont LMAs (Labor Market Areas) as redefined in 2015. LMA delineations reflect population estimates from 2010 Census and commuting patterns from The American Community Survey. This LMA edition replaces year-2005 LMAs, which are based on the 2000 Census. Note- In New England, LMAs are also known as NECTAs (New England City and Town Areas).
