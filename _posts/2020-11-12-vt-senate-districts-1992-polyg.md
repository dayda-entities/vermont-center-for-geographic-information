(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/BoundaryOther_SENA1992.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The senatorial district designations for this layer were taken from a trace map of unknown origin. A visual compilation of the traced lines and data layer BoundaryTown_TBHASH arcs was done to create the polygons forming the senate district outlines. To get a more detailed description of the how the arcs for BoundaryTown_TBHASH coverage were developed see the BoundaryTown_TBHASH coverage's detailed documentation.
