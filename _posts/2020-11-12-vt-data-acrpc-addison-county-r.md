<div style='left: 120px; top: 163.18px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.01006);'> The Future  Land  Use  Map  for  the  Addison  County Regional Plan <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>(</span><a href='http://www.acrpc.org' target='_blank'>website</a>)  consists  of  a  generalized composite  of  all municipally adopted plans as of the effective date of this plan. The map depicts the Land Use regions adopted by each municipality in six broad categories: </div><ul><li>1.Regional Centers with Mixed Residential Commercial development;</li><li>2.Villages with mixed residential and commercial development; </li><li>3.Industrial Areas; </li><li>4.Residential Regions of 2 acres or less;</li><li>5.Rural and Agricultural Regions of greater than 2 acre density; and </li><li>6.Forestry, Conservation and Floodplain Regions. </li></ul><div style='left: 214px; top: 484.98px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(0.99956);'>Planning  areas  from  expired  municipal  plans  are  also  included  in  the  Future  Land  Use Map.  While  expired  plans  have  no  standing,  they  constitute  the  best  indication  of  the regulations  governing  the  area,  since  zoning  cannot  be  changed  without  an  adopted  town plan. ACRPC’s  future  land  use  map  constitutes  one  of  the  major  pieces of information ACRPC’s Commission will review should it decide to file testimony in a land use case.</div>
