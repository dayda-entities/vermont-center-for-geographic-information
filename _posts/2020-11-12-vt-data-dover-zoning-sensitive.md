<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>This file, along with two others, was created to produce a new, official zoning map series for the Town of Dover, Vermont in 2007. This file represents the Sensitive Wildlife Resource overlay district. The base zoning district and an additional overlay district are in in separate files. The zoning bylaw was adopted in March 2007, and was amended on March 5, 2013. The zoning district boundaries did not change with this amendment, and thus these boundaries remain current. The zoning districts are represented in three files: this file of town-wide zoning districts, and files representing two overlay districts (Transfer of Development zones and Sensitive Wildlife Resource overlay). Boundaries coincide in most cases with existing parcel boundaries, or are lines connecting corners or intersections of these parcel lines. Other district boundaries coincide with other features, such as the 2500-foot contour, while a few others are somewhat arbitrary. Whenever possible, lines from existing GIS data were used to create these zoning district boundaries. In most cases, these data include Dover's parcel data and 20-foot contours generated by Cartographic Technologies, Inc., or previous zoning data from Grass Roots GIS.</span></p></div></div></div>
