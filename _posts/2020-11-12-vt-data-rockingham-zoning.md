<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>This file, along with two others of overlay districts, were created to produce a new, official zoning map series in 2009 for the Town of Rockingham and Village of Bellows Falls, Vermont. The zoning bylaw was last amended on December 12, 2013, and these boundaries are current to that amendment. The three files are originally named Zoning09_poly (town-wide zoning districts), Zoning09_NatRes (Natural Resource overlay district), and Zoning09_Design (Design Control overlay district in the Village of Bellows Falls). These shapefiles exist for distribution; the master zoning data are stored in a Geodatabase. The master Geodatabase file contains line attributes specifying the type of zoning district boundary. These files are based upon the Town of Rockingham Zoning Bylaws and several existing zoning maps. Where appropriate, zoning district boundaries were identified as coinciding with existing ground features such as roads, right-of-way boundaries, surface waters, railroads, or parcels, as setbacks from these features, or as lines connecting corners or intersections of these features.</span></p></div></div></div>
