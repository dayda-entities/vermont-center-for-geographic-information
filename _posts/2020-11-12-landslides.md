This compilation includes sites from existing county-wide landslide inventories, Vermont Geological Survey surficial geologic maps and publications, and sites from Vermont Agency of Natural Resources Stream Geomorphic Assessment. This dataset is a compilation of available data for active, inactive and relict (historic) sites and is not a complete inventory of Vermont landslides. The inventory includes historic documented sites and landslides verified by field visits or remote sensing. Points represent feature locations and are not indicative of feature extent. Definitions:Landslide: A feature formed by the downslope movement of rock and soil under the effects of gravity. The term includes a wide variety of falls, slides, and flows. They are identified by the presence of steep slopes and/or evidence of soil movement and surface erosion. Most are adjacent to streams. Features below 4 meters in height are not mapped. The mass failures identified during stream geomorphic assessment studiesare landslides.Gully: A steep, narrow stream channel incised into surficial deposits. The stream is commonly a first-order stream and the flow in the bottom is usually intermittent. Unstable gullies have very steep sides and commonly show signs of fresh erosion in the bed and/or at the gully heads.Gully head: The upstream tip of a gully. One gully may have several gully heads.Landslide-gully complex. A gully with substantial landslides on the sides or at the head.
