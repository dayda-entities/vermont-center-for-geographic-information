<div>A Road Safety Audit Review (RSAR) is a formal examination of an existing road in which an independent, multi-discipline team (the Audit Team) reports on potential safety issues. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the purpose of a RSAR is to determine which elements of the road may present a safety concern, to what extent and under what circumstances as well as to identify opportunities to mitigate the identified safety concerns.</div><div>Stewards: Information Technology, Data Owner: Office of Highway Safety</div>
