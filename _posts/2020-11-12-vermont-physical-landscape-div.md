Act 174 requires plans to identify potential areas for the development and siting of renewable energy resources and areas that are unsuitable for siting those
resources or particular categories or sizes of those resources. It furthermore requires that the standards address the potential generation from the potential
siting areas. Lastly, it requires that � in order to receive an affirmative determination � regional plans allow for the siting in the region of all types of renewable
generation technologies.

The Vermont Conservation Design Forest Block components identify areas of forest blocks that would be considered a possible constraint for renewable energy siting projects under ACT 174. �The full set of physical landscape diversity also includes surface waters and riparian areas, but those are excluded here. �
