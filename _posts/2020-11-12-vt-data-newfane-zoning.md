<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>This shapefile contains the zoning district boundaries for the Town of Newfane, Vt., and is to be used in conjunction with other GIS data for mapping. Most of these boundaries coincide with either existing parcel lines or with roads and streams. In this shapefile, the district boundaries were made to coincide with GIS representations of roads and streams where the proposed zoning district boundaries coincide with such features, but not parcel lines. No GIS parcel data for Newfane existed at the time of this shapefile was created, so scans of paper tax maps developed on an unrectified photo base were used. The zoning district boundaries that coincide with parcel boundaries are only approximate. </span></p><p><span>The zoning district boundaries, where they coincide with roads or streams are accurate to the acccuracy of the GIS data representation of those features, but where district boundaries coincide with parcel boundaries, the district boundaries will likely be off by 200 to 500 feet, or more in some areas. As such, these data should be used only in map form to give a general overally impression of the zoning district boundaries for the Town of Newfane, but cannot be used to determine actual zoning district boundaries in any locations other than where these districts coincide with roads or streams. </span></p><p><span>The shapefile Newfane\zoning_prop_taxmap.shp has been created to show the relationship with zoning district boundaries and parcel lines as represented on a series of scanned tax map images. For a more accurate depiction of the Village zoning districts (Newfane, South Newfane, and Williamsville) in relation to the scanned tax map images, see the shapefile Newfane\zoning_prop_village.shp.</span></p><p><span>Data were created in September 2008 but are current to the most recent zoning bylaw amendment of February 19, 2015.</span></p></div></div></div>
