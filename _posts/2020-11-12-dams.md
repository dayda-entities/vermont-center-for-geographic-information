<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>This dataset ï¿½is generated from from the Vermont Dam Inventory (VDI). The VDI is managed by the VT DEC's Dam Safety and Hydrology Section and contains information about Vermont's dams. The Dam Safety and Hydrology Section manages programs that promote dam safety and protection of flows in Vermont's rivers and streams. The VDI supports them in this effort by tracking physical attributes, managing construction (permits) and inspection information, and reporting to the US Army Corps of Engineers.</span></p></div></div></div>
