A River Corridor Easement (RCE) is an area of conserved land adjacent to a river or stream that was conserved to permanently protect the lateral area the river needs to be stable within.  The RCE area prohibits new development and channel management, and requires a fifty foot vegetated buffer that moves with the channel.  The River Corridor Easements file outlines where these easements are held within Vermont.
