(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/BoundaryOther_HOUS2012.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) Vermont General Assembly is periodically re-apportioned to reflect the state's changing population patterns. The current apportionment process is guided by Title 17, Chapter 34A of the Vermont Statutes Annotated. The Legislative Apportionment Board, an appointed body, proposes a draft apportionment plan. The General Assembly may refer to this plan in its enactment of legislative apportionment for the ensuing decade. The redistricting process of the Vermont State House and Senate is regulated by Act 151., which is an act relating to professional regulation and redistricting the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House district lines for this layer were downloaded from the 2012 Legislative Reapportionment web site (see link above) H. 789 was the final bill passed by the House and Senate that defined new House district boundaries.
