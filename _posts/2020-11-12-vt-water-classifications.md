<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span>The Vermont Water Quality Standards (VTWQS) are rules intended to achieve the goals of the Vermont Surface Water Strategy, as well as the objective of the federal Clean Water Act which is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's water. The classification of waters is in included in the VTWQS. The classification of all waters has been established by a combination of legislative acts and by classification or reclassification decisions issued by the Water Resources Board or Secretary pursuant to 10 V.S.A. ï¿½ 1253. Those waters reclassified by the Secretary to Class A(1), A(2), or B(1) for any use shall include all waters within the entire watershed of the reclassified waters unless expressly provided otherwise in the rule. All waters above 2,500 feet altitude, National Geodetic Vertical Datum, are designated Class A(1) for all uses, unless specifically designated Class A(2) for use as a public water source. All waters at or below 2,500 feet altitude, National Geodetic Vertical Datum, are designated Class B(2) for all uses, unless specifically designated as Class A(1), A(2), or B(1) for any use.</span></p></div></div>
