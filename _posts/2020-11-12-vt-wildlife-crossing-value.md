(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EcologicHabitat_WCV.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) WCV describes the value of the Wildlife Habitat Suitability as it approaches the state highway system. This analysis was designed to use the Wildlife Habitat Suitability coverage (EcologicHabitat_WLH) to identify sections of the roadways that are associated with high Wildlife Habitat Suitability. The values of the WCV range from 1-10, ten being the most signifigant and 1 being the least signifigant. The relative ranking systems allows for relative priority areas within different regions. This provides a roadway specific description of potential WLH and may be useful for purposes of transportation planning and identification of sites that may be priority areas for wildlife crossing structures. The Wildlife Linkage Habitat Analysis uses landscape scale data to identify or predict the location of potentially significant wildlife linkage habitats (WLH) associated with state roads throughout Vermont. For purposes of this project, WLH is a term used to describe those habitats associated with Vermont roads where wildlife move, migrate, and access various other habitats and parts of their range (similar to, but broader than, wildlife corridors). This project relied on available GIS data including: (a) land use and land cover data; (b) development density data (E911 sites); and (c) contiguous or "core" habitat data from the University of Vermont. The GIS conserved lands data was also used for this project as a way of analyzing the feasibility for conserving or ranking potentially significant WLHs identified as a result of this project. These data layers were classified according to their relative significance with respect to wildlife movement and habitat areas. A second analysis was complete to relate WLH to associated roads. The resulting spatial layer (WCV) was a polyline assigned with a value between 1 and 10, one being of the lowest signifigance and ten being the most signifigant.
