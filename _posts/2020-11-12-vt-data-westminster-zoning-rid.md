<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Ridgeline Protection overlay district, Westminster, Vermont. Other overlay overlay districts (Agricultural Land and Historical Preservation), and base zoning districts, are in separate shapefiles. Data were created in the mid 2000's. District boundaries were initially based on elevation (contours from DEMs); some boundaries were modifed to capture or eliminate areas of ridges that were visible from important viewpoints in town. Overlay was adopted into zoning bylaw July 12, 2017.</span></p></div></div></div>
