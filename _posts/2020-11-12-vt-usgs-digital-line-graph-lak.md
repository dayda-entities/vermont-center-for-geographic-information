(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/WaterHydro_DLGLAKE.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) This datalayer is comprised of lakes extracted from the USGS DLGs DLG Surface Waters coverage. Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLG's of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources. Intermediate-scale DLG data are derived from USGS 100,000-scale 30- by 60-minute quadrangle maps. If these maps are not available, Bureau of Land Management RF 100,000 are used. (1)Public Land Survey System; (2) boundaries (3) transportation; (4) hydrography; and (5) hypsography. All DLG data distributed by the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range of attribute codes, have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks. VCGI currently offers VGIS users the following DLG datalayers; WaterHydro_DLGLAKES - extracted from WaterHydro_DLGSW (4). UtilityTransmit_DLGMTT - DLG miscellaineous Transmisson Lines (1). TransRoad_DLGRD - Roads (3). TransRail_DLGRR - Railroads (3). WaterHydro_DLGSW - DLG surface waters (4). BoundaryTile_DLGTILES - Quadrangle map boundaries (1).
