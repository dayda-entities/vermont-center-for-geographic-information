Municipalities
that lack a historic downtown may obtain New Town Center designation, meeting
requirements for planning, capital expenditures, and regulatory tools that
promote a pedestrian-oriented development pattern similar to our historic
downtowns. If available, the data is submitted
by the applicant as Shapefiles otherwise the
approved map is scanned and digitized or parcel boundaries are used to build
the boundary.<span style='font-family: Lato; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);'> </span> <a href='http://accd.vermont.gov/community-development/designation-programs' target='_blank'>Learn more about the Vermont Designation Programs</a>
