(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EnvironOther_WINDACT174.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>)  The statewide wind potential layer used in the Act 174 effort represents three combined wind resource layers: Potential Residential and Small and Large Commercial Areas: 1) &quot;Environ_Wind_poly_LrgCmrcl70m&quot;; 2) &quot;Environ_Wind_poly_SmlCmrcl50m&quot;, and 3) &quot;Environ_Wind_poly_Residential30m&quot;. For insight on creating these layers see this methodology link - http://www.vtenergyatlas-info.com/wind/methodology. The data was further processed to meet the requirements of Act 174 by removing areas with “known constraints” and to identify areas with “possible constraints” as outlined in the “Act 174 Energy Planning Standards” (see municipal guidance link above). Originally created for the 2010 Renewable Energy Atlas of Vermont (REAVT) effort, this layer and the Renewable Energy Atlas are now hosted by the Energy Action Network (eanvt.org).
