(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/UtilityTransmit_ELTRN.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The ELTRN layer depicts electric transmission line corridors in Vermont. Various methods have been used to digitize features. The data layer should be used with caution. It has not been consistenly maintained since its initial release in 1992, and already had some data quality issues when it was released in 1992. Please make note that the UtilityTransmit_VELCOTRANS layer has more accurate and up-to-date information for high voltage transmission lines in Vermont (those maintained by VELCO).
