(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EnvironOther_ICEDAMAG98.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) This dataset (ICEDAMAG98) depicts the extent and severity of tree damage caused by the 1998 ice storm, which resulted in extensive tree damage in certain parts of Vermont. ICEDAMAG98 includes information gathered by the VT Department of Forest & Parks and the Green Mountain National Forest. GMNF combined these two sources to create a single statewide dataset called ICEDAMAG98.
