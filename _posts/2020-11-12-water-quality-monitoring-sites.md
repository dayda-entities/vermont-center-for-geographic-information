Water Quality Monitoring Site identifies locations across the state of Vermont where water quality data has been collected, including habitat, chemistry, fish and/or macroinvertebrates.  Currently the layer is not maintained as site locations are provided through another means to teh ANR Natural Resources Atlas.
