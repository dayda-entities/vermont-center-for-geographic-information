<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Zoning districts, Westminster, Vermont, adopted July 12, 2017. Overlay districts (Agricultural Land, Ridgeline Protection, and Historical Preservation) are in separate shapefiles. Data were finalized in 2005 to depict the current zoning districts at that time, with a minor update in 2010 to correct an error. Zoning districts have remained the same through subsequent zoning bylaw updates.</span></p></div></div></div>
