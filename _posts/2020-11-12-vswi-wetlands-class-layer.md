<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span>This dataset represents wetlands included in Vermont's Significant Wetlands Inventory (WaterWetlands_VSWI). ï¿½NWI maps were used by the State of Vermont Agency of Natural resources as a means of creating this data layer in conjunction with the VSWI. The NWI and VSWI were joined by a union, to create the new 2010 Vermont Significant Wetland Inventory data layer, representing Vermont's regulatory wetlands. The VSWI prior to 2010 was created by hand digitizing nearly two-thirds of Vermont's wetlands from RF 24000 scale NWI mylars. The remainder of the state was scanned from RF 24000 or RF 25000 scale mylars.These mylars were created by transfering wetland polygon boundaries from RF 62500 scale NWI mylars to RF 24000 scale base maps.</span></p></div></div>
