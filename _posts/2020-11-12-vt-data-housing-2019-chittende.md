<div style='text-align:Left;'><p><span>2019 spatial representation of 
residential structures and number of dwelling units (see use 
limitations) in Chittenden County. This is an updated version of the 
2018 Housing data which was originally developed in 2004. Previous 
updates have taken place yearly since 2012
to account for newly developed, renovated, or demolished housing 
structures.</span></p><p><span>Unlike previous versions of this data, 
which were based almost entirely on Grand List and municipal parcel 
data, updates since 2013 attempt to 
associate dwelling unit counts with E911 site (Esite) locations (note: 
if Esite locations were not yet established at the time of the update, 
the point was manually placed in the centroid of the parcel). It also 
associates a year-built date for housing structures (see use 
limitations).</span></p><p><span>Note: Use both the dwelling type field 
and dwelling unit count field to identify both the type and number of 
units. There are instances where a unit count is 1 and the type is 
multi-family due to how it is captured in e-911 data.</span></p></div>
