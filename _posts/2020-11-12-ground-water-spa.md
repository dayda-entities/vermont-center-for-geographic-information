<div style='text-align:Left;'><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span>Groundwater SPA. This GIS layer consists of the geographic location of the Source Protection Areas for active and inactive Public Community and Non-Transient Non-Community groundwater sources labeled by the Water System Identification Number (WSID) and source number (i.e. WL001 or IN002). The source locations are drawn from the State Drinking Water database (SDWIS). The water sources are wells and springs that predate regulations developed in the 1970s to new sources under review now. </span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span></span></p><p><span>Source Protection Area (SPA) boundaries have been located on RF 24000 &amp; RF 25000 scale USGS topographic maps by Water Supply Division (DEC) and VT Dept of Health (historical) personnel. Buffered SPAs are based on the point location of the water source(s). Refer to the SOURCE coverage documentation file for information on data sources used.</span></p><p><span>For information regarding attributes of Public Water Source feature layers, please download the:<br /></span><a href='http://anrmaps.vermont.gov/websites/OpenData/DataDictionaries/PublicWaterSourcesDataDictionary.xlsx' target='_blank'>Public Water Sources Data Dictionary</a></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span></span></p><p><span></span></p></div>
