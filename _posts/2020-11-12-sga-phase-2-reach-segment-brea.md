<div style='text-align:Left;'><p><span><span>The stream geomorphic assessment (SGA) is a physical assessment competed by geomorphologists to determine the condition and sensitivity of a stream.   The SGA Phase 2 Segment Breaks are points that indicate where the Phase 1 SGA reach was "segmented" into smaller Phase 2 segments.  These segments are determined in the field and are based on changes in topography, slope and valley setting that were not found in phase 1, and on changes in condition found in the field.  Where there found in the field a significant change in any of the above there is a segment break created.  </span></span></p></div>
