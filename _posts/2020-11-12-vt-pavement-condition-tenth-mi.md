<div>This data is a combination of 3 sources of information that are collected on different schedules. The entire National Highway System (NHS) is driven by an automated surface condition collection vehicle annually. The Vermont State highway network is driven every other year using the same methods as above. After individual paving projects are completed the Agency collects ride and rut data to ensure the work meets project specifications.</div><div>Stewards: Asset Management &amp; Performance, Data Owner: Asset Management &amp; Performance</div>
