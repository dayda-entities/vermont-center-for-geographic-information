This data contains the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District in Waitsfield, Vermont as part of the zoning bylaws adopted in 2016.  This overlay district consists of the areas designated as the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA, i.e., 100 year floodplain) through the FEMA 2013 data, or the most recent National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps.  The purpose of the overlay if for zoning and planning and is to promote public health, safety and welfare, prevent increases in flooding, minimize flood losses, manage all SFHA areas in conformance with the adopted town and hazard mitigation plans, and to ensure Waitsfield can receive federal disaster recovery funds through the NFIP.
