<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>The following link provides access to VT specific metadata created by the agencies that did the delineation. Disregard the Spatial Reference information in these individual files and only use the Spatial Reference of the data that was delivered via the Geospatial Data Gateway. These metadata files are provided only as information of the delineation process by each state and also include steps made after merging the datasets in to a seamless national layer.ï¿½</span></p></div></div></div>
