Normalized Ground Snow Loads for Idaho which was released in 1986 by the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Idaho.

The original paper map printed in 1986 was scanned, georeferenced, and rectified to broaden access and to facilitate use in GIS software.  The positional accuracy of this digital map is limited. 

DISCLAIMER: Great care has been taken to be accurate in preparing this map, but neither the publishers nor the University of Idaho can accept responsibility for any errors which appear or their consequences. The final design snow loads are the ultimate responsibility of the engineer, architect, local building official, and/or contractor in charge of the project.
