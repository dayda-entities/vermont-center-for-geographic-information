This data depicts the zoning district of Waitsfield, Vermont that represents the area of town where retail and office uses are only permitted as conditional uses in a structure which is within 200 feet from Vermont Route 100 right-of-way.  This provision is contained within Waitsfield's zoning bylaws adopted in 2016.  The structure also must be a mixed use building where no less than 50% of usable floor space has a residential use. This provision does not apply to the &quot;Oddfellows Hall/Valley Players Theatre&quot; since it has not been historically used for residential purposes.
