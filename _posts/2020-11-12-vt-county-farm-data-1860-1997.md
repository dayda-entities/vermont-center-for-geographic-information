(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/FarmStats_CNTYFARM.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) This datalayer contains Vermont agricultural data describing changes in farming activity (1860-1997), by county, extracted from U.S. Census of Agriculture. Initial 1969-1992 data was originally collected by Rick Wackernagel, UVM Extension Service, Department of Community Development & Applied Economics (CDAE), then distributed by VCGI as the data product 'FARMDATA' in 1995. VCGI has since updated and added additional years and items to the dataset, and released it as the geospatial database FarmStats_CNTYFARM. Funding for much of this data was provided by the 'Datashare' agreement between VCGI and The USDA-Natural Resources Consevation Service. Many thanks to Ray Godfrey, USDA-NRCS, for helping to make this datalayer available to the public. One may download Excel spreadsheets or comma-delimited ASCII text files of this data from the VGIS indicators webpage - http://vcgi.vermont.gov/indicators/
