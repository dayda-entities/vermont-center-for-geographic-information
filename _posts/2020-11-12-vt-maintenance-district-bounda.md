Vermont has eight transportation maintenance districts which are 
responsible for all maintenance activities on state highways, and for 
providing technical assistance to municipalities located within their 
district boundaries. Each district is managed by a District 
Transportation Administrator (DTA). The Maintenance Transportation 
Administrator (MTA) oversees all DTAs.<br /><span style='color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: '>Stewards: Information Technology, Data Owner: Maintenance and Operations Bureau<br /></span>
