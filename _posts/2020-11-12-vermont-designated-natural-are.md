<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Under Natural Areas Law (10 Vermont Statutes Annotated, Chapter 83 ï¿½ 2607) the FPR commissioner, with the approval of the governor, may designate and set aside areas in the state forests and state parks as natural areas. There are 33 designated natural areas in Vermont. In many cases, these are sites which have retained some "wilderness character," though the law is quick to explain that this doesn't mean it has to be completely natural and undisturbed by humans. Sites which support rare or vanishing species of plants and animals or areas of unique ecological, geological, scenic or contemplative recreational value are also candidates for designation. The purpose of a state natural area is ostensibly "for the use of present and future residents of the State." This has meant in practice that most natural areas are managed to perpetuate the characteristics that led to their recognition as outstanding natural sites. In the case of some natural areas, this has meant minimal public information is developed, to discourage visitation that could result in resource damage. Other natural areas are located in popular recreation sites and host thousands of visitors every year. While natural areas are protected, they are open to compatible uses, including research, hiking and nature study; because natural areas are undeveloped, there are few devices to safeguard or protect visitors from falling or slippery rocks and other hazards.</span></p></div></div></div>
