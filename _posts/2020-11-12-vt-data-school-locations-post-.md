(<a href='https://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/FacilitiesSchools_PTSCHOOL.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) FacilitiesSchools_PTSCHOOL is designed to provide point locations of every Vermont School along with the established school ID (PSID) for geographic analysis of school statistical data. The 2020 update was conducted without the benefit of Agency of Education (AOE) primary and secondary school registry information as an interim solution for potential short term pandemic related support. All features are now coincident with E911 sites. Once the dust settles a copy of the registry should be used in an additional update effort to ensure completeness. Independent schools were added from the &quot;Directory of Vermont Approved and Recognized Independent Schools, Approved Tutorials and Distance Learning Schools, Other Educational Programs, and State-Operated Facilities&quot;. Originally created in 1997 by Vermont's Regional Planning Commissions, each school name and location was verified by each School Supervisory Union and merged into a single coverage by VCGI. The next update came in 2003 with VCGI using an updated list of schools from the VT Department of Education that was subsequentially validated in 2004 by the DOE. Skipping forward to 2014, the DOE updated the representations of Vermont's public K12 school locations for school year 2014 and VCGI split the layer into two distinct feature classes: 1) VT School Locations - K-12; and 2) VT School Locations - Post-Secondary.
