Physical measurements and attributes of stream crossing structures and adjacent stream reaches which are used to provide a relative rating of aquatic organism passage and geomorphic compatibility.  Additional screening tools have been developed to identify the amount of habitat available above and below individual structures and the potential for retrofitting an existing structure for improved aquatic organism passage. Data can be used to identify And prioritize potential stream crossing replacements/retrofit projects to improve biological/stream processes and flood resiliency.
