Historic Districts listed in the State Register of Historic Places possess a significant concentration , linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development. Established in 1979 and administered by the Division for Historic Preservation, the Vermont State Register is an essential tool for the evaluation and protection of Vermont’s historic and archaeological resources. This data-set DOES NOT contain information about properties that are individually listed in the State Register of Historic Places.  <a href='https://accd.vermont.gov/historic-preservation/identifying-resources/srhp' target='_blank'>Learn more about the Vermont State Register of Historic Places.</a>
