(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/CadastralConserved_PROTECTEDLND.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The Vermont Protected Lands Database (VPLD) is a geospatial database, or GIS layer, of parcels that are currently protected from development through public ownership, private ownership, or protection mechanisms such as easements. The VPLD was designed to facilitate land-conservation planning and related efforts in Vermont. The second update to the Vermont Protected Lands Database (VPLD) &quot;CadastralConserved_PROTECTEDLND&quot; includes an additional 2,252 records over the previous 2017 release. A number of overlapping features have been reconciled while others remain to be resolved in future updates.
