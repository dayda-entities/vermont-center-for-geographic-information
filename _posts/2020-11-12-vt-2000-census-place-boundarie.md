(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/DemoCensus_PLACE2000.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) DemoCensus_PLACE2000 includes Census 2000 Place boundaries and SF1 attributes. The data was downloaded (http://arcdata.esri.com/data/tiger2000/tiger_download.cfm) by VCGI from ESRI's Data website. The downloaded shapefiles were combined into a single shapefile and reprojected to VCS NAD83. A set of Census 2000 SF1 (http://www.esri.com/censuswatch/sf1_ref.html) attributes were joined to the shapefile. For more information go to http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tlmetadata/tl2kmeta.txt
