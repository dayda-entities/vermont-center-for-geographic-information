(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/GeologicOther_REPLANDS.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) This coverage represents the results of an analysis of landscape diversity in Vermont. Polygons in the dataset represent as much as possible (in a limited area) of the physical diversity in each of the state's 8 biophysical regions (BPRs)-- hence the name "representative landscapes" (RLs). Units of physical diversity were based on elevation, bedrock type, surficial deposits, and landform. Numbers of unique landscape diversity unit labels occurring in the 8 BPRs ranged from 586 to 956. Percent of diversity units represented in the RL polygons in this dataset ranged from a low of 74% (in 25% of the Champlain Valley BPR) to 87% (in 23% of the Northern Piedmont BPR). The most efficient repesentations were in the Northeastern Highlands and the Champlain Valley, where 83% and 81% (respectively) of the landscape diversity units occurring in the BPRs were represented in 17% of the BPR area.
