LRS2018 is a Linear Referencing System layer that includes interstate, U.S., state (VT), and other transportation routes logged by the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The routes in this layer represent the ETE route system, where ETE stands for End-to-End-Based route system, meaning that routes increment from start to finish within the state. The routes represent the full routes from begining to end with no breaks for towns.<div>Stewards: Information Technology, Data Owner: Mapping Unit</div>
