(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/FacilitiesBuildings_SOVBUILDINGS.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) This data layer contains the locations of buildings/facilities owned and/or leased by the State of Vermont. Data was obtained from Buildings and General Services, part of the State of Vermont Agency of Administration, in tabular form. Addresses within this dataset were used to determine coordinate locations of buildings using a VT E911 ESITE based geocoder. This data contains information regarding building owner, building ID, location method, and building address.
