<div>A Road Safety Audit Review (RSAR) is a formal examination of an existing road in which an independent, multi-discipline team (the Audit Team) reports on potential safety issues. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the purpose of a RSAR is to determine which elements of the road may present a safety concern, to what extent and under what circumstances as well as to identify opportunities to mitigate the identified safety concerns.<br /><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Stewards: Information Technology, Data Owner: Office of Highway Safety</span><br /></div></div>
