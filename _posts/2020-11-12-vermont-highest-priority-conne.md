Act 174 requires plans to identify potential areas for the development and siting of renewable energy resources and areas that are unsuitable for siting those resources or particular categories or sizes of those resources. It furthermore requires that the standards address the potential generation from the potential siting areas. Lastly, it requires that � in order to receive an affirmative determination � regional plans allow for the siting in the region of all types of renewable generation technologies.�<span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>The Vermont Conservation Design Forest Block components identify areas of forest blocks that would be considered a possible constraint for renewable energy siting projects.</span>
