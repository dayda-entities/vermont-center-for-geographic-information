(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EnvironOther_SOLARACT174.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The only statewide solar potential layer available used in the Act 174 effort comes from the 2010 Renewable Energy Atlas of Vermont (REAVT) effort (EnvironOther_Solar). This layer and the Renewable Energy Atlas are now hosted by the Energy Action Network (eanvt.org). This ground mount only resource was further processed to meet the requirements of Act 174 by removing areas with “known constraints” and to identify areas with “possible constraints” as outlined in the “Act 174 Energy Planning Standards” (see Act 174 municipal guidance link above).
