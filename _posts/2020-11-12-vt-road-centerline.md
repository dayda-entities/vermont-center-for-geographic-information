The centerlines were originally developed under contract by Greenhorne and O'Mara under the guidance of VCGI (1992). VCGI was the original steward of the road centerline data between 1992 and 2004. The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) is now considered the steward of this data layer. Updates have been performed over the years by VCGI, RPCs, and VTrans. The VT Agency of Transportation has taken over the update and maintenance of the road centerline data layer and has revised the layer to match &quot;Official&quot; highway mileage. NOTE: TransRoad_RDS meets the requirements articulated in the VGIS Road Centerline Data Standard (http://vcgi.vermont.gov/resources/standards).This layer is the most reliable source for official VTrans road class (AOTCLASS) information. However, this layer may not include every private road, and the road name information is not may not match perfectly with the EmergencyE911_RDS data layer. The EmergencyE911_RDS road centerline layer maintained by VT's E911 Board as the most up-to-date roadname information. It was originally based on TransRoad_RDS, and is therefore very similar. However, it includes all private roads and generally more reliable road name and address range information. There was a significant change in the schema in the June 2013 release as part of the effort between VTrans and E911 to merge their two datasets. The data layer includes the field structure agreed to by both entities, but most of the fields that are E911's have not been populated in this release.<br /><span style='color:rgb(77, 77, 77);'>Stewards: Information Technology, Data Owner: Mapping Unit</span>
