(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/BoundaryOther_SENA2002.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) The Senatorial district lines for this layer were obtained from the Vermont Legislature website (http://www.leg.state.vt.us/reports/02redistricting/), while the geospatial lines were selected from the datalayer BoundaryTown_TBHASH. Each Senatorial district is comprised of existing Vermont town boundaries. The redistricting process of the Vermont State House and Senate is regulated by Act 151., which is an act relating to professional regulation and redistricting the Senate and the House of Representatives. During conference negotiations between the House and Senate, it became necessary (for technical reasons) to append ALL of S.300, including both House and Senate reapportionment plans, to House Bill H.761, the Professional Regulation bill, which was passed as Act 151, An Act Relating to Professional Regulation and Redistricting the House and Senate, completing the 2002 legislative reapportionment.
