<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span>This dataset is derived from a project by the Vermont Center for Ecostudies(VCE) and Arrowwood Environmental(AE) to map vernal pools throughout the state of Vermont. AE and VCE are mapping locations of potential vernal pools throughout Vermont, and recruiting a corps of volunteers to field-verify the presence of these potential pools. In the process, we will develop a GIS layer of potential and known vernal pools, as well as a database populated with biological and physical attributes of each verified pool. With partial funding from the Vermont State Wildlife Grants Program, potential vernal pools will be identified using color infrared aerial photographs.</span></p><p><span><span>Data was collected remotely using color infrared aerial photo interpretation.  "Potential" vernal pools were mapped and available for the purpose of confirming whether vernal pool habitat was present through site visits.  This dataset represents only those sites which have not yet been field-visited or verified as vernal pools.  This statewide dataset was collected in 2009-2011.</span></span></p><p></div></div></p>
