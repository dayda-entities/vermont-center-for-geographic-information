<div>All data are compiled by the <a href='https://www.healthvermont.gov/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Vermont Department of Health</a>, and are preliminary and subject to change. Case information is updated daily by 12:00pm ET, reflecting counts as of end of previous day. For more information, see the <a href='https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/infectious-disease/2019-novel-coronavirus' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>full VDH COVID-19 page</a>. This open data service is provided on accord with the <a href='https://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/opendata/lifecycle/VCGI_COVID19_LifeCyclePolicy.pdf' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>COVID-19 Life Cycle Policy</a>.

Includes non-Vermont residents who were tested in Vermont (i.e. seeking care in Vermont, visiting Vermont).</div><div><br /></div><div><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Tests</span> (total_tests and new_tests) reflect people tested. The people-tested number reflects tests for a current COVID-19 infection. Includes number of people tested in Vermont and Vermont residents tested outside of Vermont, for example, testing conducted in neighboring state’s hospital lab or public health lab. Please note we may not have all the negative results from all reference labs.</div><div><br /></div><div>The <span style='font-weight: bold;'>total_tests</span> field should be used to assess how many individuals have been tested to date. <br /></div><div>The <span style='font-weight: bold;'>new_tests</span> field represents the number of new individuals tested for the first time compared to the day before. <br />These testing values differ from those in the <a href='https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/vt-covid-19-pcr-test-results-of-unique-individuals-by-day' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>PCR Test Results of Unique Individuals by Day table</a> as those fields reflect the date of specimen collection (as opposed to the date the result is received by the Department of Health).  The testing fields within the <a href='https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/vt-covid-19-pcr-test-specimens-by-day' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>PCR Test Specimens by Day table</a> are presented at the specimen level and are not de-duplicated to the person level (a single person can have more than one specimen collected).  <br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Deaths </span>(total_deaths and daily_deaths) reflect persons known to have COVID-19. Death certificate may be pending.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Recovered</span> numbers (daily_recovered and total_recovered) are estimated in two ways: 1) People who have tested positive for COVID-19 report they have recovered to our investigation teams during their follow-up calls. 2) Thirty days or more have passed since the date the person's illness began. (If that information is not available, we use the date the positive test is reported to the Health Department.)</div><div><br /></div><div><span style='font-weight:bold;'>People Completed Monitoring</span> (completed_monitoring) includes travelers and contacts who have completed the 14 day symptom checking period.</div>
