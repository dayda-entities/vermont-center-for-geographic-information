<p>Table layer that contains statewide daily counts of PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 for that day, by date of collection and reporting lab. Numbers represent PCR tests only, do not include repeat testing of the same individual (numbers are de-duplicated) or any other kind of test.  Percent positivity for the most recent 2 dates are blank to account for outstanding tests to be returned for that date.</p><p>This table can be used to assess how many new positive PCR tests there are by specimen collection date for individual people.<br /></p>
