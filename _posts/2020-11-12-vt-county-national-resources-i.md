(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EcologicStats_CNTYNRI.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) This collection provides tabular USDA - Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), National Resources Inventory (NRI) data (1982-1997), by County. Sources include, the U.S. Bureau Census Bureau, Census of Population and Housing, for total county area figures. The National Resources Inventory (NRI) is a statistically based sample of land use and natural resource conditions and trends on U.S. nonfederal lands. NRI data are collected at scientifically selected sample sites. The sample constitutes a two-stage stratified area sample of the entire country. Samples are located in all counties and parishes of the 50 states and in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, and selected portions of the Pacific Basin. The first-stage sampling unit, or primary sampling unit (PSU), is an area/segment of land; the second-stage sampling units are points located within the PSUs. Detailed NRI data are collected for the specific sample points, but some items are also collected for the entire PSU/segment. Some data, such as total surface area, federally owned land, and area in large water bodies, are collected on a census basis external to the sample survey. The NRI database accounts for and represents the total area of the United States, but very little information is given for points on federal lands. Statistics derived from the NRI database are estimates and not absolutes. This means that there is some amount of uncertainty in any result obtained using NRI data. This data has been made available through the USDA-Natural Resources Consevation Service.
