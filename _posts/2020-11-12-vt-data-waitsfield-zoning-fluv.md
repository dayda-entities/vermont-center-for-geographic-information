This data contains the Fluvial Erosion Hazard Area Overlay District (FEHO) which is included within the zoning bylaws adopted in 2016.  The FEHO represents that area within town that is vulnerable to erosion damage from flooding of the Mad River and is based on river science mapping conducted during an in field assessment.  The mapped area represents those areas that are highly sensitive to erosion due to naturally occurring stream channel migration.  New development is limited within this overlay district.
