(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/BoundaryTile_USNGVT.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) USNGVT is a U.S. National Grid Index (1000m x 1000m) covering Vermont. It is a polygon feature class originally constructed by the Center for Interdisciplinary Geospatial Information Technologies at Delta State University with support from the US Geological Survey under the Cooperative Agreement 07ERAG0083. VCGI merged UTM zone 18 and 19 into a single layer, the projected to VCS NAD83. Further information about the US National Grid is available from http://www.fgdc.gov/usng and a viewing of these layers as applied to local geography may be seen at the National Map, http://www.nationalmap.gov. This dataset includes the USNG grid for parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut that lie in UTM zone 18.
