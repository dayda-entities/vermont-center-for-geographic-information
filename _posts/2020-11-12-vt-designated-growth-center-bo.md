Growth centers aim to align public infrastructure and private building investments with a local framework of policies and regulations to ensure that 20 years of future development will enhance the vitality of the designated commercial center, while protecting farm and forest land outside the growth center. If available, the data is submitted by the applicant as Shapefiles otherwise the approved map is scanned and digitized or parcel boundaries are used to build the boundary. <a href='http://accd.vermont.gov/community-development/designation-programs/growth-centers' target='_blank'>Learn more about the Vermont Designation Programs</a>
