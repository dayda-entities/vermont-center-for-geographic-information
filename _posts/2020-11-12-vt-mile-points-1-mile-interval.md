The mile points data layer is comprised of discrete locations based
on specific measured intervals along a route.  These intervals are
represented along a linear-referenced route system, whether a point is defined
every  1/10th mile, ½ mile, or mile, a coordinate is being
applied to the linear measurement along the route.  These points provide guidance to the users on linear measures in a
spatial context.
