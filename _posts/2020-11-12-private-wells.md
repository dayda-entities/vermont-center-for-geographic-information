<div style='text-align:Left;'><p><span>Private wells in this layer come from the Department of Environmental Conservation's Water Supply Data Composite. Managed by the Water Supply Division's Well Driller and Well Location Program, the database contains private well information submitted by Vermont licensed well drillers. Licensed well drillers have been required to submit well completion reports (well logs) to the state since 1966. Well tags have been required since 1986. NOTE: the data contained here is only as accurate as what was submitted - many wells were completed, but not reported, many reports have missing information, were recorded inaccurately or poorly located geographically.Â </span></p><p><i><font size='4'>Help us improve our database.
