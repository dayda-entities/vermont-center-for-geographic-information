The EAB Infested Area includes both the Confirmed Infested Areas and the High Risk Areas. Confirmed Infested Areas are within 5 miles of a known infestation. While symptoms may not be obvious, it is likely that EAB is present in much of this area. High Risk Areas extend 5 miles from the outer edge of a Confirmed Infested Area. EAB is likely expanding into, and present in some of this area. This  layer is dynamic to areas of expansion. Updates to this layer happen simultaneous to confirmed sites and therefore is a dynamic dataset. The date of which the dataset was updated last, can be found within the attributes of the layer (EABDate). <div><br /></div><div><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: medium;'>All ash in Vermont is within the </span><a href='https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/emerald_ash_b/downloads/eab_quarantine_map.pdf' style='color: rgb(151, 203, 236); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: medium;' target='_blank'><font color='#0000cd'>federal EAB quarantine boundary</font></a><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: medium;'>.
