(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EconStats_MEALROOMTAX.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) Town-based spatial representation of Meals and Room Tax Statistics (meals, room rents, and alcohol). Information pertaining to fewer than 10 accounts has been suppressed to protect confidentiality of taxpayer information. This dataset is derived from annual calendar-year reports updated 180 days after reporting periods. It contains data for multiple years--collated via YEAR field. Therefore, it has stacked polygons on towns that are represented in more than 1 year. Apply a query to work with a year-based subset (e.g., YEAR = 2016).
