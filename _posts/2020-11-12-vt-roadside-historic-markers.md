Roadside Historic Site Marker program has proven an effective way to commemorate Vermont’s many people, events, and places of regional, statewide, or national significance. Over 200 cast-aluminum green markers, crested with the distinctive gold state seal, are placed throughout Vermont to provide a fascinating glimpse into the past and insights into the present. This layer identifies the approximate locations.  <a href='http://accd.vermont.gov/historic-preservation/roadside-markers' target='_blank'>Learn more about the Vermont Roadside Historic Site Marker Program</a>.
