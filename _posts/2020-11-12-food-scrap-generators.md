Here you will find Vermont businesses and institutions (such as restaurants, grocery stores, markets, hospitals, schools, food manufacturers, assisted living facilities, correctional facilities, and more) with the estimated tons of food scraps they might generate. It was created using three main datasets�the Vermont Department of Health�s (VDH) 2013 Food Producers data, Stone Environmental� s (Stone) original food scrap generator list for all towns from their 2009 Vermont Compost/Biogas Data Viewer project (developed with assistance and input from the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District), and Vermont Sustainable Jobs Fund�s (VSJF) 2013 Farm?to?Plate Food Atlas dataset. These datasets were compared and combined to provide the bulk of the food scrap generators (FSG) of food waste generators in the state. This map contains inaccuracies. With over 6,000 entries and a near constant opening and closing of businesses around the state, it is challenging to keep up-to-date information. Weekly food scrap tonnages for food scrap generators are estimates only.
