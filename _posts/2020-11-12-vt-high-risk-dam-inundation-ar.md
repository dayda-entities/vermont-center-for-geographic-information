(<a href='http://maps.vcgi.vermont.gov/gisdata/metadata/EmergencyHazards_DAMINUND.htm' target='_blank'>Link to Metadata</a>) Preliminary release Storm-Day dam inundation areas digitized from various source Emergency Action Plans. These dams were prioritized for digitization as high risk dams, as defined by Vermont Emergency Management. Data depicts a limited set of dams, and some inundation areas are not completely digitized - as noted in the COMPLETE attribute.
